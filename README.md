### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Michele, a Frontend Software Developer living in Denver, Colorado.

Having spent the previous 10 years as an educator, I'm pumped to be challenging myself in brand new ways!
Currently on my way to becoming a skilled React developer!

I am a seasoned traveler, lover of the outdoors and music, and a jigsaw puzzle fanatic!
